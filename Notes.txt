	 COUNTER: Delete the closed job node in engineer when job is marked closed

	 *ON Reopen add node back

	 Change status of job in (web)

	 Use that to update engineer in job when ever engineer is updated or better replace the existing engineer

	 on job update (status or anthing) replace the job object in engineer

	 Also check job reschedule

	 on job reassign remove the relation in engineer_job and remove the job from engineer object (delete the node)


	 any customer update/ machine update/ should also happen in related jobs and related jobs fields in engineers (Maybe on updating jobs , it should get replaced in engineers, check for that)
	 

	 Use functions to add created and updated date in jobs inside engineers


	 check notification functionality

Low priority:

FInd place for constanst in webapp

Look what is 'updatedTime1' in my-view1.html

Use child_added instead of value event in both app and web to improve performance

Ensure validation in edit engineer (web)

Add schedule date in appgetDateFromTime

While open allow to edit shedule time ?

Modify job access righs

Implementation of access rights

 Test if attendance timing entered is same as shown in web app

 Constansts for Job types (web)


 RemoteDBLocation lat , longitude values in android Double

 Decide data type of lat, long. It is string in customer and double in engineers

 Disable update button until job is loaded

 request location permission again if not provided while marking attendance

 Check if you can have just once call(Which will also call on update) for engineers which entire app can use
 See if the same thing can be done for webapp

 changes in map on engineer list (Change in the field where location is stored)

 Table in job description element has improper allignment


 show list of jobs in engineers details

 

 (web) check the meaning of reflectToAttribute and notify and remove where not required
